            Dubbed "Simple Notes" this is a mobile app that I made in the summer with the goal of developing expertise
            in cross-platform development.<br/><br/>

            I researched various cross-platform frameworks, but decided on react-native due to my previous experience
            with JavaScript, and good documentation. I used Expo along with terminal to help deploy and test my app.   
            Working with react-native was one of the most painful event in my life. The aforementioned documentation was out of date,
            so I had to rely on source code from GitHub and community forums to figure out the interface.
            Additionally, many features weren't built in like I expected, such as mavigation, and I had to program it myself.
            But, after many nights, I managed to finish a functioning notes app.
            <br/><br/>
            <span style="font-size: 2.5em">Next steps</span><br/><br/>
            I learned a lot by struggling with react-native, and hope to apply that experience during co-op.
